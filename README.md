# FileReader

A JavaScript file reader, extends functionality of the built-in JS FileReader.
This reads the contents of a FileList into an internal array which contains the File object and its contents as read by FileReader.

TODO LIST:
- Ideally, ReadMode enum could be accessible without instantiation
- fix logic for reading files directly from the constructor
- more callbacks?
- usage examples
